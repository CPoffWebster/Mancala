# Mancala
Project created in CS210 - Artificial Intelligence

Mancala supports a regular game of Mancala. It can be played with one or two live player. Against random players. 
Against players using alphabeta within a set branch factor. 
Or against alphabetafull that analyzes all available branches.
In order to change the type of gameplay, test1 must be altered.


This project was created for a class at Clark University.
Not all files were created by me from scratch.

Mancala.py was created entirely by me from scratch.
in games.py payer2 was created to support having multiple turn iteration

The main body of the other files are needed to run a full mancala game, but were not created by me.
